## The Problem

### Manual Inventory Chaos

Publishing companies rely on complex spreadsheets to track 200+ titles across multiple warehouses, leading to errors, delays, and missed opportunities. This manual process costs approximately 20 hours per week in administrative overhead and results in stockouts that can lose 15-30% of potential sales.

**Our Solution:** Automated inventory tracking with real-time synchronization across all warehouses and sales channels.

### Complex Financial Calculations

Publishers struggle with manual profit and royalty calculations involving RRP, unit costs, sales thresholds, and percentage-based payments. These calculations are error-prone and time-consuming, often delaying author payments by weeks.

**Our Solution:** Automated profit margin calculations and royalty processing with configurable thresholds and payment schedules.

### Lack of Predictive Intelligence

Without proper analytics, publishers can't predict when to reprint titles, leading to either stockouts or overstock situations. This reactive approach costs publishers an average of £50,000 annually in lost sales and excess inventory costs.

**Our Solution:** Intelligent reprint triggers based on sales velocity and configurable stock level thresholds.

## Differentiators

### Publishing-Specific Intelligence

Unlike generic inventory systems, BookStock is built specifically for book publishing workflows with native support for ISBN tracking, series management, and publishing-specific calculations like RRP-based profit margins and royalty structures.

### Multi-Warehouse Optimization

While other systems treat warehouses as separate entities, BookStock provides intelligent allocation recommendations and automated stock movement tracking to optimize inventory across UK, US, and online fulfillment centers.

### Automated Financial Intelligence

BookStock automatically calculates complex publishing financials including profit margins (RRP/2 - unit cost), threshold-based royalties, and sales velocity analytics that generic systems cannot handle without extensive customization.
