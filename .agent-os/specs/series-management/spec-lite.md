# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement series grouping to organize related book titles into named collections (e.g., "Opinionated Guides") with automated aggregation of inventory, sales, and profitability metrics. Publishers can create series, assign titles, view series-level analytics combining all member titles' performance data, and perform bulk operations across all titles within a series.
