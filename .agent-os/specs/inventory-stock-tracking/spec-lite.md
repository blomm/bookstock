# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement real-time inventory tracking across multiple warehouses with automated stock level updates from movement transactions. Users can view current stock per title per warehouse in a dashboard, record movements (prints, sales, transfers, damages, adjustments), and receive low-stock alerts based on configurable thresholds. All inventory changes are automatically calculated and logged with comprehensive audit trails.
